# Creative Agency Website

## General info
This is my first website project based on HTML and CSS. The site created for a fictitious Creative Agency in order to learn the first lines of code in Visual Studio Code. The site presents the basic information and sub-pages that every service website should contain. And these are information about us, contact, price and services.
